              &nbsp;Hi, I'm Praveesh, a software engineer passionate about crafting
              efficient and scalable solutions. With expertise in Java
              development, cloud solutions, and full-stack web development, I
              thrive on bringing ideas to life through code.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have over three years of experience as a Systems
              Engineer at Infosys, where I built solutions for clients based on
              their business requirements. My primary focus is backend Java
              development, and I have a strong grasp of React.js, having
              developed multiple full-stack projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I work as a Java Backend Developer at Incture
              Technologies, where I focus on writing efficient and scalable code
              to deliver robust solutions. I strive to implement best practices
              and innovative approaches that contribute to the overall success
              of our projects.
